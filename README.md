# Preliminary-diagnosis-of-Alzheimer-s-using-Virtual-Reality
Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a global challenge, affecting millions worldwide, with no current cure, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis. Early diagnosis plays a crucial role in managing the disease, as it allows slowing its progression and improves the quality of life for patients through appropriate treatment. However, existing preliminary assessments often lack precision, prompting the development of alternative methods like VR tests, which simulate reality effectively. To meet specific hospital requirements and enhance realism, the project aims to adapt the test with personalized features, aiming to provide insights into medical factors affecting daily functionality for improved diagnostic accuracy and patient care.

The aim of the project is to develop a test that will serve as an additional assessment tool for diagnosing doctors. This test will provide insights into the medical factors influencing the daily functionality of the subject, offering a rare perspective that complements traditional diagnostic methods. By integrating medical insights with observations of the subject's daily activities and functioning, the test aims to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the diagnostic process, ultimately leading to better patient care and management.

Since VR assessments already exist, our goal is to adapt the test to meet specific Carmel hospital requirements, such as time limits and the preference for Israeli products, among others. Additionally, we aim to enhance the test by adding personalization features, allowing it to mimic real-life scenarios as closely as possible.
